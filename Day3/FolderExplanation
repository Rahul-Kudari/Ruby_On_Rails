Rails Project Configuration Guide

The Core Structure
* bin/: The "Executable Tools." Contains scripts like bin/rails that automate code generation, database management, and server startup.
* config/: The "Application Brain." The central hub for environment settings, database credentials, and routing rules.
* application.rb: The "Global Hub." Boots the app, loads gems, and sets universal rules (like Time Zones). Errors here prevent the app from starting.
* puma.rb: The "Engine Room." Configures the web server's "muscle" by defining threads and workers to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.

Environments (config/environments/)
* development.rb: The "Builder's Bench." Enables instant code reloading and detailed error reports for fast debugging.
* test.rb: The "Sandbox." An isolated area to run tests and simulate errors without risking real data.
* production.rb: The "Vault." Optimizes speed and locks down security by hiding errors and forcing HTTPS (config.force_ssl = true).

Initializers (config/initializers/)
Small Ruby files that run once during startup to set specific rules:
* assets.rb: The "Stylist." Instructions for mashing CSS/JS into fast, compressed files for production.
* content_security_policy.rb: The "Security Guard." Prevents script injection (XSS) by whitelisting trusted content sources.
* filter_parameter_logging.rb: The "Privacy Mask." Blurs sensitive data (passwords/CC numbers) in logs.
* inflections.rb: The "Grammar Coach." Teaches Rails how to pluralize irregular words (e.g., Person -> People).
* ci.rb: The "Test Detector." Adjusts settings for automated environments (like GitHub Actions) to speed up testing.

Configuration Files (.yml)
* database.yml: The "Bridge." Connects your app code to your physical data storage.
* cable.yml: The "Live Wire." Configures WebSockets for real-time features like chat or live alerts.
* cache.yml: The "Short-term Memory." Stores "pre-calculated" results in high-speed memory for instant retrieval.
* queue.yml: The "Shift Schedule." Manages background workers (Sidekiq) to handle heavy tasks like emails.
* storage.yml: The "Shipping Manifest." Defines where to upload files (Local Disk vs. Cloud like Amazon S3).
* deploy.yml: The "Launch Checklist." Steps to build, test, and ship your code to a live server.

The Boot Sequence
1. boot.rb: Grabs the keys (Loads Bundler and Gems).
2. application.rb: Sets the rules (Universal configurations).
3. environment.rb: Flips the switch (Initializes the entire engine).
